# About Me

Hi, I’m Glenn Goodman.

I help growing companies get real value from their CRM investments.

With over 15 years of experience and more than 45 Salesforce implementations under my belt, I’ve worked with startups, mid market teams, and complex organizations to design CRM solutions that actually support how people work, not slow them down. My background spans Salesforce, HubSpot, Salesloft, and modern AI driven tools, giving me a platform agnostic perspective focused on outcomes, not software loyalty.

My approach is practical and business first. I focus on simplifying processes, improving data quality, enabling users, and aligning technology with revenue operations. Whether that means cleaning up technical debt, designing scalable automation, integrating systems, or advising on CRM selection, my goal is always the same: help teams move faster, work smarter, and make better decisions with confidence.

Clients value me as a trusted advisor, not just an implementer. I bring strong business acumen, clear communication, and a bias toward action. I’m known for asking the right questions, translating complexity into clarity, and delivering solutions that are maintainable long after the project ends.

If you’re investing in CRM, rethinking your current setup, or looking for an experienced partner who understands both the technology and the business behind it, I’d love to connect.

**Let’s build something that actually works.**
