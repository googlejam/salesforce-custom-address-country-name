🚀 New Open Source Project: Salesforce Custom Address Country Name Lookup

Ever struggled with custom Address fields only storing country codes (US, CA, GB) but not the full names?

I just released a lightweight solution that auto-populates full country names using Salesforce's State/Country Picklists via Schema API.

✅ No custom metadata required
✅ Works with any custom Address field
✅ Flow-compatible invocable Apex
✅ 100% test coverage
✅ MIT License

Perfect for orgs using custom Address fields on any object. Check it out!
